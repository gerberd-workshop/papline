‘PAPline’ is an abbreviation for “Performing Archaeogenetic Pipeline”, it can be downloaded from https://www.github.com/gerberd-workshop/papline and used freely under Debian based Linux distributions. This pipeline was written in bash and is supplemented by scripts written in R and python v3.8.10 programming languages. The program aims to analyse raw sequencing data and perform read alignment, apply various data filtering methods, and finally provide summary tables about the run with additional haplogroup assessments, genetic sex determinations, aneuploidies, etc. The concept of ‘PAPline’ is highly similar to the ‘Paleomix’ 117 and the ‘EAGER’ 118, however, we aimed to create a program that needs only a few adjustments before actual application, and is also user friendly. The software and R packages that are needed to be installed and added to the path to use the ‘PAPline’ are listed below. Regular updates are planned for ‘PAPline’ in the future by releasing new versions every second year. For full README please check the supplementary data of Gerber et al. 2022 "Interdisciplinary analyses of Bronze Age communities from Western Hungary reveal complex population histories". Any suggestions are welcome to make this software better :)
